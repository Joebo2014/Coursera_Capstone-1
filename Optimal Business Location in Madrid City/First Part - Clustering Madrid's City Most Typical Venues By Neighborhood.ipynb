    "As the first part of this project to find the optimal location for a mexican restaurant in Madrid. It is first needed to analyze the city's most typical venues by neighborhood, so it is possible to have an idea of which are the actual leisure places where people go spend their time. To begin this analysis, neighborhood clusters will be created and their venues analysed in similarity terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the most frquent venues per neighborhood get extracted, for the second part of this project a segmentation by nationality of the people living in each neighborhood will be carried out, in order to determine in which neighborhood would be more advisable to open a mexican food restaurant based on the results of the previous segmentation and the analised venues.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this first part, the data that will be used to analyse the venues comes from the Foursquare API. This project will be devoloped using the Python 3.6 programing language as the main working tool."
